Its hierarchical structure and real-time updates make it flexible and developer-friendly, providing a more efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs. In this guide, we'll get into the fundamentals of GraphQL and explore why it's gaining popularity as a modern alternative to traditional RESTful APIs."

GraphQL, on the other hand, enables clients to define the shape and structure of the response, reducing unnecessary data and improving efficiency."

It excels in scenarios where clients require specific data, want to reduce data traffic, or need real-time updates. GraphQL is particularly beneficial for applications with complex data requirements and diverse client needs."
